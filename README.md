Antora-based Akka Documentation

This folder contains the sources for parts of the [Akka web site](https://akka.io/akka-platform-guide).

This folder is structured as follows:
- The root directory contains the `Makefile` for the documentation generation process.
- The structured documentation is located under `docs-source/`.

Contributions to the documentation are welcome and encouraged.

Detailed information about working with the documentation is provided in the [docs-source](docs-source/README.adoc) folder.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

This part of the Akka documentation is built using [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/), from asciidoc sources.
The building process is managed by `make` using the [makefile](./Makefile) script.


To build the documentation, use `make` with the following commands:

* `make html-author-mode` 

    Generates the documentation, in 'author' mode, to display review comments and TODOs. The result is available at `target/staging/index.html`.

* `make all` (default) 

    Generates the complete documentation bundle.

* `make html`

    Generates the html documentation and homepage. 

* `make check-links`

    Checks that the external links point to a reachable URL.

* `make list-todos`

    List all the TODOs, review comments, unresolve references, etc. from the documentation.
