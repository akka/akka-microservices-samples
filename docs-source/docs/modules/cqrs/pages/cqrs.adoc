== Concepts

CQRS documentation in the link:{akka-projection}/use-cases.html[Akka Projection documentation].

The idea of CQRS is to establish specific data representations suited to answer the queries we want to handle. These representations (or "projections", or "read-side models") are built up by listening to the stream of events that update the entities.

== Akka Projection

link:{akka-projection}/[Akka Projection] is designed to listen to a stream of events and built up data in a different representation, a projection.

The entry-point to its API is the `EventSourcedProvider` which listens to the events of an entity which are marked with a tag. The tag has to be attached to the entity when it is created.

Our shopping cart events get tagged with a tag that contains an index so we can have parallel listeners to events for different sets of shopping carts.

== TODO explain tag better, more tags

The projection defines a source provider which defines the events which should be projected to the read model. To do that it specifies the base class for the events it should provide (`ShoppingCart.Event`), that these events come from the Cassandra read journal and event tag.

For this projection we choose "at-least once" semantics -- in some scenarios the same event might be seen more than once. Which events have been process will be tracked by storing their offset to Cassandra by using the link:{akka-projection}cassandra.html#at-least-once[`CassandraProjection.atLeastOnce`].

Each event will be passed to the event handler which should  update the read model of our entity (`ShoppingCartProjectionHandler`).
