== Concepts

CQRS documentation in the link:{akka}/typed/cqrs.html[Akka Reference documentation for Akka Persistence].

== Write model

The write model is a shopping cart.

The implementation is based on a sharded actor: each `ShoppingCart` is an link:{akka}/typed/cluster-sharding.html[Akka Cluster Sharding] entity. The entity actor `ShoppingCart` is an link:https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/typed/persistence.html[EventSourcedBehavior].

Events from the shopping carts are tagged and consumed by the read model.
