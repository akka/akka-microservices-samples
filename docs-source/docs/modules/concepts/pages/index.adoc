This section explains the concepts that motivate Akka's take on how to implement microservices using Event
Sourcing and CQRS. Microservices built using Event Sourcing and CQRS adhere to the properties of a
link:{reactive-manifesto}[Reactive System] and are often called Reactive Microsystems.

Read the xref:introduction-traditional-architecture.adoc[introduction] for an explanation of the motivation for
Reactive Microsystems, and a high level overview of the key concepts that power Reactive Microsystems.

== Properties of Reactive Microsystems

* xref:isolation.adoc[]
* xref:autonomy.adoc[]
* xref:mobility.adoc[]
* Single Responsibility
* Event-Driven
* State Ownership

== Patterns and techniques recommended for Reactive Microsystems

* xref:event-sourcing.adoc[]
* xref:cqrs.adoc[]
* Message Driven
* Events and Commands - Event Storming
* Memory Image Pattern
* Circuit Breakers
* Reactive Programming
* Reactive Streams
** Backpressure
* Brief Summary of DDD concepts
** Bounded Context
** Stateful Aggregate
** Consistency Boundaries
** Anti-Corruption Layer
** Events-First DDD


== Implementation Concepts

We strongly recommend building your Reactive Microsystems using the link:{akka}[Akka] toolkit. Following is an
overview of some features in the Akka toolkit you are likely to use:

* Actor model
* Supervision
* Akka Streams
* xref:clustering.adoc[]
** Sharding
** Distributed Data
** SBR
* Akka Persistence
* Akka Projection


== Deployment Concerns

* xref:services.adoc[]
** xref:service-discovery.adoc[]
** xref:service-clients.adoc[]
** xref:grpc-services.adoc[]
* xref:internal-and-external-communication.adoc[]
* Akka Management
** Management
** Bootstrap
** Service Discovery
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
