This section explains the concepts that motivate Akka's take on how to implement microservices using Event
Sourcing and CQRS. Microservices built using Event Sourcing and CQRS adhere to the properties of a
link:{reactive-manifesto}[Reactive System] and are often called Reactive Microsystems.

Read the xref:introduction-traditional-architecture.adoc[introduction] for an explanation of the motivation for
Reactive Microsystems, and a high level overview of the key concepts that power Reactive Microsystems.

== Properties of Reactive Microsystems

== Implementation Concepts

We recommend building your Reactive Microsystems using the link:{akka}[Akka] toolkit. Following is an
overview of some features in the Akka toolkit you are likely to use:

* Actor model
** Supervision
* Akka Streams
* xref:implementation/clustering.adoc[]
** Sharding
** SBR
* Akka Persistence
* Akka Projections


== Deployment Concerns

* xref:deployment/services.adoc[]
** xref:deployment/service-discovery.adoc[]
** xref:deployment/service-clients.adoc[]
** xref:deployment/grpc-services.adoc[]
* xref:deployment/internal-and-external-communication.adoc[]
* Akka Management
** Management
** Bootstrap
** Service Discovery
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
