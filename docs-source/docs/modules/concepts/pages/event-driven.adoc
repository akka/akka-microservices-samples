An Event is some data emitted from a component for anyone listening to consume. In Event Driven systems, components announce a location where they expose their events. So a _Component A_ emitting events will use a well-known location to publish them but not know which components are consuming the events. This well-known location is implemented using an ordered queue. Sometimes the queue is indexable so consumers can keep track of the events already consumed and the events pending.

xref:message-driven.adoc tools are the building block for Event Driven systems.
