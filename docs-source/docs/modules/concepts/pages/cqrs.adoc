CQRS documentation in the {akka-projection}/use-cases.html[Akka Projections documentation].

The idea of CQRS is to establish specific data representations suited to answer the queries we want to handle. These representations (or "projections", or "read-side models") are built up by listening to the stream of events that update the entities.

== Akka Projections

{akka-projection}/[Akka Projections] is designed to listen to a stream of events and build up data in a different representation, a projection.

The entry-point to its API is the `EventSourcedProvider` which listens to the events of an entity which are marked with a tag. The tag has to be attached to the entity when it is created.
