To install Akka Cloud Platform on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you must have a Google Cloud Platform account and a project.

If you are a first time GCP user, please follow these steps:

. Create your Google account at https://console.cloud.google.com[https://console.cloud.google.com {tab-icon}, window="tab"].
.  Create a project.

== Deploy from marketplace

With your account and project ready, open the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/lightbend-public/akka-cloud-platform[Akka Cloud Platform {tab-icon}], or go to https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application[Kubernetes Engine Applications {tab-icon}, window="tab"] and search for "Akka Cloud Platform”. When you are on the product page, go ahead and purchase a plan.

Once you've purchased a plan to use the Akka Cloud Platform, proceed to configure it. Make sure you have a project selected on the GUI or the options to purchase and configure will be disabled.

To completely configure and use the Akka Cloud Platform you need to fill in a few fields:

. The GKE cluster — This is the cluster where you are installing the operator. Use "Create a new cluster" if you don't have one.
. A Namespace — Keeping the Marketplace offering in a specific namespace will ease follow up operations and will enforce separation of concerns.
. An App instance name — Select a unique name. We recommend using the default or `akka-platform-operator-1`.
. The akka-operator.serviceAccount.name — This is the name of the service account used by the operator to access Kubernetes resources.
. The Reporting Service Account — This is the service account used for reporting data to Google.

Finally, take a moment to review all the permissions the Akka Clout Platform operator will use in order to operate your applications.

Click `Deploy`.

== Delete a Kubernetes cluster

You can use the https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list[GCP GUI {tab-icon}, window="tab"] to delete the cluster.
