= Akka Operator reference
:page-toclevels: 3

include::partial$include.adoc[]

The deployment descriptor of an Akka Microservice that is managed by the Akka Operator is defined in a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Kubernetes Custom Resource {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. The following sections provide an example and details about configuration of interest.

== AkkaMicroservices deployment descriptor (CRD) example

You can view the https://lightbend.github.io/akka-operator-helm/akka-operator/crds/v1/akka-microservices-crd.yml[schema definition of the AkkaMicroservices deployment descriptor (CRD) {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. A https://lightbend.github.io/akka-operator-helm/api-reference/v1/shopping-cart-service-full-cr.yml[deployment descriptor (CR) containing all properties {tab-icon}, window="tab"] provides a factitious example.

== Scale the number of Pods

The `replicas` field in the deployment descriptor defines the number of Pods that will be used.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  replicas: 3
----

You can scale the number of pods by applying the changed deployment descriptor. Kubernetes will add or remove Pods to adjust to the desired number.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

Another way of changing number of Pods is to use `kubectl scale` without changing the deployment descriptor:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl scale --replicas=3 akkamicroservices shopping-cart-servics
----

== Resource requests and limits

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[Resources for Containers {tab-icon}, window="tab"] can be defined in the Akka Microservices deployment descriptor.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi"
    requests:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "1"
----

For multi-threaded applications such as the JVM, the CFS scheduler limits are an ill fit, because they will restrict the allowed CPU usage even when more CPU cycles are available from the host system. This means your application may be starved of CPU time, but your system appears idle.

To avoid CFS scheduler limits, it is best not to use `resources.limits.cpu` limits, but use `resources.requests.cpu` configuration instead.

[#logback]
== Configure Logback

A custom Logback configuration can be provided to the deployment without building a new image. Make sure that your application is already configured to use the {akka}/typed/logging.html#slf4j-backend[Slf4j backend {tab-icon}, window="tab"] for logging.

Create a logback configuration you want to apply in a `logback.xml` file:

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>EASY LOGGING - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="TRACE">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>

</configuration>
----

Create the secret in the cluster:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl create secret generic my-logback --from-file=logback.xml=./logback.xml
----

Modify the deployment descriptor to use this configuration:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  logbackSecret:
    secretName: "my-logback"
----


Apply the logback configuration by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

The Akka Operator will automatically mount the `logback.xml` and include system property `logback.configurationFile` to the application, which means that it will be loaded instead of the default `logback.xml` that is bundled with the application. You have to restart the Pods for it to take effect, which will happen automatically by a rolling update when you apply changes of the deployment descriptor.

== Akka Cluster status

Akka Operator checks and reports the Akka Cluster membership status. It includes the number of replicas that have joined the Akka cluster and their state from the cluster point of view. This can be Up or Non-Up. The total number of replicas is a sum of Up plus Non-Up. Up means that a replica has successfully joined the cluster.

Comparing the number of Up nodes to the current number of replicas can provide an understanding of whether all running replicas are in a normal state or not. Similarly, the number of Non-Up replicas tells us how many replicas are not in the normal operating state. 

Additionally to Up and Non-Up, there is also Unreachable. This is the number of unreachable nodes from the view of one (the oldest node). For example, if the oldest node was partitioned from the rest of a cluster of Up nodes it would have a high number of unreachable, while if you ask the other nodes they would only say that one node, the oldest, is unreachable.

These numbers can be useful to watch the Akka Cluster state during rolling updates to make sure it is in a normal state. See xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting deployment status] for some examples.

== Namespaces

The Akka Operator manages Akka Microservices in all namespaces of the Kubernetes cluster, which means that you should only install the operator once. It is possible to configure the operator to only manage a specific namespace if that would be needed.

You can define a specific namespace that the operator should manage with the following value of the Helm chart when installing the operator.

[source,shell script]
----
--set java_tool_options="-Dakka.operator.application-namespace=the-app-ns -Xlog:gc -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=75 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75"
----

The operator itself can still be installed in a different namespace, or in the same namespace.
