= I: Set up your development environment

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

ifdef::review[REVIWERS: will Java devs also user sbt or maven? If the latter, we need to make Build tool a separate section with Scala and Java tabs?]


To follow tutorial steps you will need a code editor, a build tool, and `grpcurl` (a CLI for sending gRPC calls). You can use your preferred code editor. We provide the steps for using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA {tab-icon}, window="tab"] from JetBrains. For the Scala version of the example, we use `sbt` as the build tool. 

This tutorial uses Cassandra and Kafka. You may run local installations during development, but we recommend running both services using https://docs.docker.com[Docker {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. The template project's root directory includes a https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] https://docs.docker.com/compose/[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] file that you can use to run Cassandra and Kafka. The provided Docker Compose file also runs Zookeeper which is required to run a Kafka broker.

The following sections provide links for downloading and installing:

* <<IntelliJ IDEA>>
* <<The sbt tool>>
* <<The grpcurl tool>>
* <<Docker and Docker Compose>>

We also provide downloadable versions of the example at different phases of completion. And, you will likely want to test locally before deploying to the cloud. You will need to understand how to configure to run locally. The following sections provide information on:

* <<Downloadable example source>>
* <<Configuring for local development>>

== IntelliJ IDEA

To install IntelliJ and prepare to develop the Scala example, follow these steps:
 
. Download and install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ {tab-icon}, window="tab"].
. From the *Preferences* menu, add the *Scala* plugin.

== The sbt tool

For the Scala Shopping Cart example, we use `sbt` as the build tool. https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html[Install sbt] if you haven't already.

[TIP]
====
`sbt` is an interactive shell. If you start it with the `sbt` command, you can repeatedly run tasks like `compile` and `test` in the sbt shell. In the tutorial we use the full command for clarity, such as `sbt compile`. You can run tasks independently in this way, but it's faster to leave the `sbt` shell running and only enter the tasks. For example:

----
$ sbt
...
sbt:shopping-cart-service> compile
...
sbt:shopping-cart-service> test
...
----
====

== The grpcurl tool

The https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl {tab-icon}, window="tab"] tool is useful for making gRPC calls from the command line. It is used in tutorial procedures and we recommend that you install it as described in https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[the grpcurl documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

== Docker and Docker Compose
[#docker]

See the instructions for installing https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker {tab-icon}, window="new"] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose {tab-icon}, window="tab"] on your platform. 

== Downloadable example source

We encourage you to enter the example code, even if by copying and pasting. If you get stuck or prefer to skip some main steps, we provide source files for download. The introduction of each page with tutorial development steps includes links to two zip files: one with completed source up to that point, and one with completed source for the steps described on that page.

If you would like to run the full example, you can download the link:_attachments/6-shopping-cart-complete-scala.zip[full implementation]. In this case, we suggest you scan the tutorial instructions to identify the source files that you can learn from.


== Configuring for local development

When running microservices locally using `sbt`, you will likely want to run multiple Akka Cluster nodes to observe fault tolerance. Within each node, or `ActorSystem`, each service must use unique Akka port numbers when running on the same machine.  

To simplify the process of running multiple clusters locally, we've provided three `.conf` files named `local1`, `local2`, and `local3` with the port values shown below. By default, the `sbt run` command starts an `ActorSystem` with the default `application.conf`. All of the local configuration files include `application.conf`.

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: I don't think that the commands for running with these conf files should be here, but in the steps for deploying, once they've gotten more than one service to deploy locally. The table is good here for reference, though and we can link to this section from the procedure. I'm also not sure this is the place to introduce `ActorSystem`, but I left it in for now.]

Run one Akka Cluster node with `local1.conf` as follows:

[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----


Similarly, you can start two additional nodes with `local2.conf` and `local3.conf`:

[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local2.conf run
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local3.conf run
----

The local configuration files set the following ports for each of the example services:

.shopping-cart-service ports

|Node |Akka Cluster |Akka Management HTTP |Akka gRPC

|local1.conf
|2551
