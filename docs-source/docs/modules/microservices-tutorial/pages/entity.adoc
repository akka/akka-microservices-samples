= IV: Create the Event Sourced Cart entity
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

In this part, we will create the `ShoppingCart` entity that manages the state for each shopping cart. The `ShoppingCart` will use Event Sourcing to persist events that represents changes to the state of the cart. We only need to handle the command to add items to the cart for now. In the next part of the tutorial we will expand it to handle more commands and events.

The architectural overview shows how the entity is related to the Cart service. It writes events to the event journal, which we will use later to create projections:

image::example-entity.png[Example entity]

On this page you will learn how to:

* implement an Event Sourced entity
* unit test the entity
* distribute the entities over the nodes in the Akka Cluster
* send requests from the gRPC service implementation to the entities
* update the deployment from the previous step

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: re: bullet 3 above, the Initialization section only contains a brief statement about distributing among nodes. I think we should introduce and motivate use in the overview of this page or maybe in the architectural overview to explain that this is one thing that helps us achieve Reactive?]

If you are unfamiliar with Event Sourcing, refer to the xref:concepts:event-sourcing.adoc[Event Sourcing] section for an explanation.

== Commands and events

Commands are the "external" API of an entity. The state of the entity can be changed only by commands. The results of commands are emitted as events. A command can request state changes, but different events might be generated depending on the current state of the entity.

== State

The state of the `ShoppingCart` contains a `Map` of items that have been added to the cart. Add this to the `ShoppingCart` object.

<1> Matching the `AddItem` command
<2> Persisting the `ItemAdded` event and replying to the sender

The returned `ReplyEffect` reacts on the commands by deciding which effect they should have on the entity.

Our business logic allows only items to be added which are not in the cart yet and require a positive quantity. If an `AddItem` command is accepted, the `Effect.persist` applies an event to the cart's state and makes sure this event is stored before replying to the command.

If the validation fails we want to send back an error message. The reply can be a success or an error and that is the reason for using the `StatusReply`.

See all available effects in the {akka}/typed/persistence.html#effects-and-side-effects[Akka reference documentation] {akka}/typed/persistence.html#effects-and-side-effects[{tab-icon}, window="tab"].

== Event handler

The events represent changes of the entity's state and are the only way to change it. The entity creates events from commands, other parts of the application may listen to the created events. Other parties can't send events.

The events are continuously persisted to the Event Journal datastore, while the entity state is kept in memory. In case of a restart the latest state gets rebuilt by replaying the events from the Event Journal.

Aligning with the command handler above, the entity's event handler reacts on events and updates the state. Notice that there are no decisions on events, they are applied without any checks.

== Initialization

To glue this together we need some initialization code:

[.tabset]
Java::

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.java[tags=shoppingCart;init]

----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;init]
----

<1> The entities are distributed over the nodes in the Akka Cluster with Cluster Sharding.

<2> [.group-scala]#Command and event handler are defined with the `EventSourcedBehavior`.# [.group-java]#An `EventSourcedBehavior` is created for the `ShoppingCart`.#

<3> Snapshotting is an optimization to reduce recovery when the entity is started.

<4> Restarting with backoff in case of failures.

Then you need to call the `ShoppingCart.init` from `Main.scala`:

[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/Main.scala[tag=ShoppingCart]
----

== Serialization

The state, commands and events of the entity must be serializable because they are written to the datastore or sent between nodes within the Akka cluster. We will use the built-in CBOR serialization.

The state, commands and events are marked as `CborSerializable` which is configured to use the built-in CBOR serialization.

The template project includes this marker interface `CborSerializable`:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/CborSerializable.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/CborSerializable.scala[]
----

The interface is configured in the `serialization.conf` file to enable CBOR serialization. `serialization.conf` is included in `application.conf`.

[source,hocon]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/serialization.conf[]
----

== Unit testing

To test the `ShoppingCart` entity you can write a unit test using the [.group-scala]#`EventSourcedBehaviorTestKit`# [.group-java]#`TestKitJunitResource`#.

A test for the `AddItem` command looks like this in [.group-scala]#`src/test/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartSpec.scala`# [.group-java]#`src/test/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartTest.java`#:

[.tabset]
Java::

[source,java,indent=0]
----

----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/test/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartSpec.scala[]
----

Run the test with:

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt test
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
mvn test
----

You can learn more about the [.group-scala]#`EventSourcedBehaviorTestKit`# [.group-java]#`TestKitJunitResource`# in the {akka}/typed/persistence-testing.html#unit-testing[Akka reference documentation] {akka}/typed/persistence-testing.html#unit-testing[{tab-icon}, window="tab"]

== Sending commands to the entities

We want to send commands to the entities from the gRPC service implementation. In the xref:grpc-server.adoc[previous step] we wrote a dummy implementation of `addItem` in the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`. You can now replace that with sending `ShoppingCart.AddItem` command from `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`.

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-java/src/main/java/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[]
----

If the command was successful the entity replied with `StatusReply.Success` with the updated `ShoppingCart.Summary`. If the validation in the entity failed it replied with `StatusReply.Error`, which will fail the [.group-scala]#`Future`# [.group-java]#`CompletionStage`# that is returned from `askWithStatus`.

Also, you need to include the new `ActorSystem` parameter to the constructor when creating an instance of `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` from the `ShoppingCartServer`.

== Cassandra

The events are stored in Cassandra and the template project includes configuration for that in the `src/main/resources/persistence.conf` file.

You have to enable this configuration by including `persistence.conf` in `application.conf`:

[source,hocon]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/application.conf[tag=persistenceInclude]
----

== Run

First you need to start Cassandra with:

include::template.adoc[tag=docker]

Run the service with:

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local1.conf
----

Try it with `grpcurl`. Add 3 socks to a cart:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Try the validation logic by trying to add the same item again, which should result in an error:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":5}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

To verify that the events are actually saved, and the state can be recovered from the events you can stop the service with `ctrl-c` and then start it again.

Add 2 t-shirts to the same cart:

[source,shell script]
----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"t-shirt", "quantity":2}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Then the returned updated cart should still contain the 3 socks.

Another fun experiment is to start several instances of the service on different ports (2552, 2553) and then interact with different carts via the different gRPC servers (gRPC ports 8101, 8102, 8103).


[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local2.conf run
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local2.conf
----


[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local3.conf run
----

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local3.conf
----

You can stop the service with `ctrl-c`.

You can leave Cassandra running or stop it with:

[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose down
----
