== Used Akka modules

This example project uses

- {akka}/typed/cluster-sharding.html[Akka Cluster Sharding] to distribute processing
- {akka-persistence-cassandra}/[Akka Persistence Cassandra] to use Event Sourcing
- {akka-projection}/[Akka Projections] to enable CQRS
- {akka-grpc}/[Akka gRPC] to implement a gRPC service API
- {akka-management}/[Akka Management] for health checks
