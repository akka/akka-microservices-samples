This tutorial illustrates how microservices can interact to implement a shopping cart system. It demonstrates use of the following Akka Platform features:

* Akka Cluster Sharding: to distribute processing
* Akka Persistence Cassandra: to use Event Sourcing
* Akka Projections: to enable CQRS
* Akka gRPC: to implement a gRPC service API
* Akka Management: for health checks



The topics listed below show how to build the services piece by piece, from scratch. After testing locally what you build in each main step, you can also deploy to the cloud.
