This tutorial shows how to build the functionality for a Shopping Cart system. When complete, end users will be able to add items to a cart and checkout, creating an order. Analytics also measure item popularity based on the quantity sold. As shown in the following illustration, the system includes three services that use xref:concepts:grpc-services.adoc[gRPC] as a transport mechanism: Cart, Order, and Analytics.

Each user's cart is represented by an Cart Entity. Cart state is persisted using xref:concepts:event-sourcing.adoc[Event Sourcing]: When a user updates their cart, the Entity persists commands to a Cassandra database in an _Event Journal_. Using xref:concepts:cqrs.adoc[Command Query Responsibility Segregation] (CQRS), which separates read and write responsibility, {akka-projection}/[Akka Projections] {akka-projection}/[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] provide the data necessary for the Order and Analytics services.

The `PopularityProjection` is derived from the contents of all shopping carts.

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: there are still some missing pieces here: an explanation of the queryDB; why an arrow from PopularityProjection goes up to queryDB and comes down from Entity, when this is what the Analytics service needs to use, right?;  Why is PublishEvents projection written to Kafka and subscribed to by Analytics instead of PopularityProjection?]


Follow these main steps to build functionality a bit at a time and deploy to the cloud as you go:
