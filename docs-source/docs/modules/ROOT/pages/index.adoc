:description: Guided documentation of Akka for specific use cases

include::partial$include.adoc[]

This guide provides information on using the Akka Platform and Akka Cloud Platform for developers, administrators, and dev/ops. It focuses on getting you up and running by covering the basics of Microservices and Cloud deployment, as well as the fundamental concepts that underlay _Reactive_ development.

Akka Platform is a toolkit for building highly concurrent systems that are scalable, highly efficient, and resilient by using _Reactive Principles_. The Akka Platform is available from Lightbend as https://akka.io/[Akka Open Source software (Akka OSS) {tab-icon}, window="tab"], as Akka Cloud Platform, or as a https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-subscription[Direct Subscription or Private Offer {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

Akka Cloud Platform adds tooling for deployment on Kubernetes and is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=7hhouu843kzmgqs6besqjjsbf[Amazon Web Services (AWS) {tab-icon}, window="tab"] and https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/lightbend-public/akka-cloud-platform[Google Cloud Platform (GCP) {tab-icon}].

Whether you are new to _Reactive principles_, or an experienced Akka user, you will find something of use in this guide. The guide complements the {akka}[Akka reference documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"], which presents all Akka features in detail.


== Akka Platform
Akka is a platform for designing scalable, resilient systems that span processor cores and networks. Akka allows you to focus on meeting business needs instead of writing low-level code to provide reliable behavior, fault tolerance, and high performance.

*Akka provides:*

* Multi-threaded behavior — without the use of low-level concurrency constructs like atomics or locks; relieving you from even thinking about memory visibility issues.
* Transparent remote communication between systems and their components — relieving you from writing and maintaining difficult networking code.
* A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic, scales in or out, on demand — enabling you to deliver a truly reactive system.

Akka’s use of the actor model provides a level of abstraction that makes it easier to write correct concurrent, parallel and distributed systems. The actor model spans the full set of Akka libraries, providing you with a consistent way of understanding and using them.


== Akka Cloud Platform
Akka Cloud Platform enhances Akka by adding operational tooling, services, and support. It is easily accessible from marketplaces, such as AWS and GCP.

*Why use Akka Cloud Platform?*

* Satisfy easy-to-deploy and operational needs for Development and SRE teams
* Reduce implementation time for integrating with cloud services
* Zero business barriers for getting started

*What does Akka Cloud Platform provide?*

* Simple deployment and scaling of Kubernetes-powered Akka applications
* Integrated Telemetry & Ops/DevOps tooling
* Simple integration paths for relevant cloud services (e.g., Kafka, Cassandra, data stores)
* Pay-as-you-go and custom pricing available through popular Cloud Marketplaces
* Legal, purchasing, and billing integrated into these marketplaces

== How to get the most out of this guide
For a code-first experience, have a look at the Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial, which walks you through an example project and explains how features from the Akka ecosystem fit together to build Reactive Systems. The tutorial will point you to the relevant concepts where applicable.

If this is your first experience with Reactive frameworks or Akka, we recommend reviewing the Concepts section. This section presents some background and ideas behind Reactive. You can read about those concepts when introduced in the tutorial, or read them first if you prefer a more theoretical overview before diving into the code. There you will learn, for example:

* The challenges that Reactive Architecture can help you overcome
* A summary of Reactive Principles
* The benefits of using Akka

== Cloud deployment

Each section of the tutorial provides for both running locally or deploying to the cloud. The cloud deployment steps use the Akka Cloud Platform. If you are working through the cloud deployment steps, we recommend reviewing the xref:deployment:index.adoc[Akka Cloud Platform] section of this guide and the details for xref:deployment:cloud-deployment.adoc[] and your specific platform.

Kubernetes has become the de-facto platform for deploying in the cloud. The Cloud deployment page provides an overview of how the Kubernetes deployment works with the Akka Cloud Platform. Each cloud deployment section of the tutorial details how to run in Kubernetes using the Akka Cloud Platform.

== Akka Microservices tutorial

The xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] illustrates how to implement an Event Sourced CQRS application with Akka Persistence and Akka Projections.

The tutorial shows how to build and run each service step by step:

== How to...

Some development tasks arise from requirements on existing projects. The xref:how-to:index.adoc[] section contains guidance on introducing new features or architectural improvements to an existing codebase.
