= Part 3: Event Sourced entity

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

In this part, we will create the `ShoppingCart` entity that manages the state for each shopping cart. The `ShoppingCart` is using Event Sourcing to persist events that represents changes to the state of the cart. At first, it only will handle the command to add items to the cart. In xref:complete-entity.adoc[next part] of the tutorial we will expand it to handle more commands and events.

.This part of the xref:overview.adoc[full example] will focus on the `ShoppingCart` entity.

You will learn how to:

* implement an Event Sourced entity
* unit test the entity
* distribute the entities over the nodes in the Akka Cluster
* send requests from the gRPC service implementation to the entities
* update the deployment from the xref:grpc-server.adoc[previous step]

Read the xref:concepts:event-sourcing.adoc[Event Sourcing] section if you are unfamiliar with that concept.

== Event Sourced entity

=== Commands

The state of the entity can be changed only by sending commands to it. The commands are the "external" API of an entity. Commands request state changes, but they might lead to different events depending on the current state of the entity.

Define a `ShoppingCart` object and the `AddItem` command:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;commands]
----

=== Events

The corresponding `ItemAdded` event:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;events]
----

=== State

The state of the `ShoppingCart` contains a `Map` of items that have been added to the cart.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;state]
----

=== Command handler

You implement the Event Sourced entity with the `EventSourcedBehavior`. It defines command handlers:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;commandHandler]
----

<1> Matching the `AddItem` command
<2> Persisting the `ItemAdded` event and replying to the sender

The returned `ReplyEffect` reacts on the commands by deciding which effect they should have on the entity.

Our business logic allows only items to be added which are not in the cart yet and require a positive quantity. If an `AddItem` command is accepted, the `Effect.persist` applies an event to the cart's state and makes sure this event is stored before replying to the command.

If the validation fails we want to send back an error message. The reply can be a success or an error and that is the reason for using the `StatusReply`.

See all available effects in the {akka}/typed/persistence.html#effects-and-side-effects[Akka reference documentation].

=== Event handler

The events represent changes of the entity's state and are the only way to change it. The entity creates events from commands, other parts of the application may listen to the created events. Other parties can't send events.

The events are continuously persisted to the Event Journal datastore, while the entity state is kept in memory. In case of a restart the latest state gets rebuilt by replaying the events from the Event Journal.

Aligning with the command handler above, the entity's event handler reacts on events and updates the state. Notice that there are no decisions on events, they are applied without any checks.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;eventHandler]
----

=== Initialization

To glue this together we need some initialization code:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[tags=obj;init]
----

<1> The entities are distributed over the nodes in the Akka Cluster with Cluster Sharding.

<2> Command and event handler are defined with the `EventSourcedBehavior`.

<3> Snapshotting is an optimization to reduce recovery when the entity is started.

<4> Restarting with backoff in case of failures.

Then you need to call the `ShoppingCart.init` from `Main.scala`:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/Main.scala[tag=ShoppingCart]
----

== Serialization

The state, commands and events of the entity must be serializable because they are written to the datastore or sent between nodes within the Akka cluster. We will use the built-in CBOR serialization.

The state, commands and events are marked as `CborSerializable` which is configured to use the built-in CBOR serialization.

The template project includes this marker interface `CborSerializable`:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/CborSerializable.scala[]
----

The interface is configured in the `serialization.conf` file to enable CBOR serialization. `serialization.conf` is included in `application.conf`.

[source,hocon]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/serialization.conf[]
----

== Unit testing

To test the `ShoppingCart` entity you can write a unit test using the `EventSourcedBehaviorTestKit`.

A test for the `AddItem` command looks like this in `src/test/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartSpec.scala`:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/test/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartSpec.scala[]
----

Run the test with:

----
sbt test
----

You can learn more about the `EventSourcedBehaviorTestKit` in the {akka}/typed/persistence-testing.html#unit-testing[Akka reference documentation]

== Sending commands to the entities

We want to send commands to the entities from the gRPC service implementation. In the xref:grpc-server.adoc[previous step] we wrote a dummy implementation of `addItem` in the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`. You can now replace that with sending `ShoppingCart.AddItem` command from `ShoppingCartServiceImpl`.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[]
----

If the command was successful the entity replied with `StatusReply.Success` with the updated `ShoppingCart.Summary`. If the validation in the entity failed it replied with `StatusReply.Error`, which will fail the `Future` that is returned from `askWithStatus`.

Also, you need to include the new `ActorSystem` parameter to the constructor when creating an instance of `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` from the `ShoppingCartServer`.

== Cassandra

The events are stored in Cassandra and you have to add the configuration for that in `src/main/resources/persistence.conf` file:

[source,hocon]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/persistence.conf[]
----

Also, include `persistence.conf` in `application.conf`:

[source,hocon]
----
include::example$02-shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/resources/application.conf[tag=persistenceInclude]
----

== Run

First you need to start Cassandra with:

----
docker-compose up -d
----

Run the service with:

----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

Try it with `grpcurl`. Add 3 socks to a cart:

----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Try the validation logic by trying to add the same item again, which should result in an error:

----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":5}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

To verify that the events are actually saved and the state can be recovered from the events you can stop the service with `ctrl-c` and then start it again.

Add 2 t-shirts to the same cart:

----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"t-shirt", "quantity":2}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Then the returned updated cart should still contain the 3 socks.

Another fun experiment is to start several instances of the service on different ports (2552, 2553) and then interact with different carts via the different gRPC servers (gRPC ports 8101, 8102, 8103).

----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local2.conf run
----

----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local3.conf run
----

You can stop the service with `ctrl-c`.

You can leave Cassandra running or stop it with:

----
docker-compose down
----
