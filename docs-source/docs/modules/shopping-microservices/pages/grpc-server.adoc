include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

In this part, we will create the `ShoppingCartService` with gRPC. At first, it will only have one operation to add items to a cart. It will be a dummy implementation that is only logging the calls. In later parts of the tutorial it will be expanded with more operations and real implementations.

.This part of the xref:overview.adoc[full example] will focus on the gRPC `ShoppingCartService`.

You will learn how to:

* define the interface of the gRPC service
* implement the service interface
* initialize and run the server
* interact with the service from the command line
* deploy for the first time to the cloud

The motivation for using gRPC as inter-service protocol is explained in the link:{akka-grpc}/whygrpc.html[Akka gRPC "Why gRPC?"] documentation.

== Service definition

First you should define the interface of the service in a protobuf service descriptor. It should be located in the `src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto`.

[source,protobuf]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/protobuf/ShoppingCartService.proto[]
----

<1> Defines the requests a client may send to the service in the serivce definition
<2> Describes the request to add an item to the shopping cart
<3> For simplicity, most requests share a common response, for easier evolution of an interface, separate responses are often a better choice (See xref:how-to:evolve-grpc-apis.adoc[] for details).

== Generate code

From the service descriptor source code will be generated by the Akka gRPC plugin when you compile the project.

----
sbt compile
----

== Service implementation

Let's implement the `ShoppingCart` trait. Create a `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` class that extends the generated `ShoppingCartService` trait. Implement the `addItem` method from the trait by logging the call and return a successful `Future`.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.scala[tag=addItem]
----

== Server

The service implementation is running by an Akka HTTP server. Add the following server initialization code in a `ShoppingCartServer` object.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCart.scala[]
----

== Main

To run the service as a Java application we need a class with a `main` method. Add a `Main` class that is initializing the `ActorSystem` and the `ShoppingCartServer` like this:

include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/src/main/scala/shopping/cart/ShoppingCartServer.scala[tag=start-grpc]
----

== Run

You can run this service with:

----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

Note the log output from the `ShoppingCartServer`

----
Shopping online at gRPC server 127.0.0.1:8101
----

Try it with link:https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl].

Add 3 socks to a cart:

----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"socks", "quantity":3}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Add 2 t-shirts to the same cart:

----
grpcurl -d '{"cartId":"cart1", "itemId":"t-shirt", "quantity":2}' -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8101 shoppingcart.ShoppingCartService.AddItem
----

Note the logging from the `ShoppingCartServiceImpl` in the console of the service.

You can stop the service with `ctrl-c`.
